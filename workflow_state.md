# Workflow State & Rules (STM + Rules + Log)

*This file contains the dynamic state, embedded rules, active plan, and log for the current session.*
*It is read and updated frequently by the AI during its operational loop.*

## State

*Holds the current status of the workflow.*

```yaml
Phase: CONSTRUCT # Current workflow phase (ANALYZE, BLUEPRINT, CONSTRUCT, VALIDATE, BLUEPRINT_REVISE)
Status: COMPLETED # Current status (READY, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED_*, NEEDS_*, COMPLETED)
CurrentTaskID: FE_BE_INTEGRATION # Identifier for the main task being worked on
CurrentStep: STEP_8 # Identifier for the specific step in the plan being executed
```

## Analysis for Frontend-Backend Integration

Now that both the React frontend and ASP.NET Core backend API have been implemented separately, we need to integrate them to create a complete Phase 1 MVP. The integration will focus on:

1. **API Service in Frontend**
   - Create API service to communicate with the backend
   - Set up Axios for API requests
   - Handle API responses and errors

2. **Code Execution Flow**
   - Update the code editor to send code to the backend for execution
   - Display execution results from the backend
   - Add loading indicators during execution

3. **Error Handling**
   - Handle connectivity issues with the backend
   - Display appropriate error messages to the user
   - Implement fallback behavior for offline development

4. **Development Setup**
   - Configure proxy settings in the frontend
   - Create scripts for running both frontend and backend simultaneously
   - Document the complete development workflow

## Analysis for Missing Phase 1 Component: Backend API Setup

Based on the project configuration, Phase 1 (MVP) should include a backend API component using ASP.NET Core that was not implemented yet. This should be completed before moving to Phase 2 enhancements.

The backend API should focus on:

1. **Basic ASP.NET Core API Setup**
   - Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project
   - Configure CORS to allow frontend communication
   - Set up basic project structure

2. **Code Execution Endpoints**
   - Create endpoints for JavaScript and C# code execution
   - Implement *development-only* direct execution using Process.Start
   - Ensure proper input/output handling

3. **Integration with Frontend**
   - Update the frontend to communicate with the backend API
   - Replace placeholder execution with actual API calls
   - Handle API responses and errors

**Important Constraints:**
- This implementation should be clearly marked as development-only and not for production use
- Security measures will be minimal at this stage as proper sandboxing will be implemented in Phase 3
- Documentation should clearly state the security limitations

## Rules

*Embedded rules governing the AI's autonomous operation.*

**# --- Core Workflow Rules ---**

RULE_WF_PHASE_ANALYZE:
  **Constraint:** Goal is understanding request/context. NO solutioning or implementation planning.

RULE_WF_PHASE_BLUEPRINT:
  **Constraint:** Goal is creating a detailed, unambiguous step-by-step plan. NO code implementation.

RULE_WF_PHASE_CONSTRUCT:
  **Constraint:** Goal is executing the `## Plan` exactly. NO deviation. If issues arise, trigger error handling or revert phase.

RULE_WF_PHASE_VALIDATE:
  **Constraint:** Goal is verifying implementation against `## Plan` and requirements using tools. NO new implementation.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_01:
  **Trigger:** Explicit user command (`@analyze`, `@blueprint`, `@construct`, `@validate`).
  **Action:** Update `State.Phase` accordingly. Log phase change.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_02:
  **Trigger:** AI determines current phase constraint prevents fulfilling user request OR error handling dictates phase change (e.g., RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01).
  **Action:** Log the reason. Update `State.Phase` (e.g., to `BLUEPRINT_REVISE`). Set `State.Status` appropriately (e.g., `NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL`). Report to user.

**# --- Initialization & Resumption Rules ---**

RULE_INIT_01:
  **Trigger:** AI session/task starts AND `workflow_state.md` is missing or empty.
  **Action:**
    1. Create `workflow_state.md` with default structure.
    2. Read `project_config.md` (prompt user if missing).
    3. Set `State.Phase = ANALYZE`, `State.Status = READY`.
    4. Log "Initialized new session."
    5. Prompt user for the first task.

RULE_INIT_02:
  **Trigger:** AI session/task starts AND `workflow_state.md` exists.
  **Action:**
    1. Read `project_config.md`.
    2. Read existing `workflow_state.md`.
    3. Log "Resumed session."
    4. Check `State.Status`: Handle READY, COMPLETED, BLOCKED_*, NEEDS_*, IN_PROGRESS appropriately (prompt user or report status).

RULE_INIT_03:
  **Trigger:** User confirms continuation via RULE_INIT_02 (for IN_PROGRESS state).
  **Action:** Proceed with the next action based on loaded state and rules.

**# --- Memory Management Rules ---**

RULE_MEM_READ_LTM_01:
  **Trigger:** Start of a new major task or phase.
  **Action:** Read `project_config.md`. Log action.

RULE_MEM_READ_STM_01:
  **Trigger:** Before *every* decision/action cycle.
  **Action:** Read `workflow_state.md`.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_STM_01:
  **Trigger:** After *every* significant action or information receipt.
  **Action:** Immediately update relevant sections (`## State`, `## Plan`, `## Log`) in `workflow_state.md` and save.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_LTM_01:
  **Trigger:** User command (`@config/update`) OR end of successful VALIDATE phase for significant change.
  **Action:** Propose concise updates to `project_config.md` based on `## Log`/diffs. Set `State.Status = NEEDS_LTM_APPROVAL`. Await user confirmation.

RULE_MEM_VALIDATE_01:
  **Trigger:** After updating `workflow_state.md` or `project_config.md`.
  **Action:** Perform internal consistency check. If issues found, log and set `State.Status = NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`.

**# --- Tool Integration Rules (Cursor Environment) ---**

RULE_TOOL_LINT_01:
  **Trigger:** Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase.
  **Action:** Instruct Cursor terminal to run lint command. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT` if errors.

RULE_TOOL_FORMAT_01:
  **Trigger:** Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase.
  **Action:** Instruct Cursor to apply formatter or run format command via terminal. Log attempt.

RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01:
  **Trigger:** Command `@validate` or entering VALIDATE phase.
  **Action:** Instruct Cursor terminal to run test suite. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_TEST` if failures, `TESTS_PASSED` if success.

RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01:
  **Trigger:** AI determines code change needed per `## Plan` during CONSTRUCT phase.
  **Action:** Generate modification. Instruct Cursor to apply it. Log action.

**# --- Error Handling & Recovery Rules ---**

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_LINT_01:
  **Trigger:** `State.Status` is `BLOCKED_LINT`.
  **Action:** Analyze error in `## Log`. Attempt auto-fix if simple/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run lint via RULE_TOOL_LINT_01. If success, reset `State.Status`. If fail/complex, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT_UNRESOLVED`, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01:
  **Trigger:** `State.Status` is `BLOCKED_TEST`.
  **Action:** Analyze failure in `## Log`. Attempt auto-fix if simple/localized/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run failed test(s) or suite via RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01. If success, reset `State.Status`. If fail/complex, set `State.Phase = BLUEPRINT_REVISE`, `State.Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL`, propose revised `## Plan` based on failure analysis, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_GENERAL_01:
  **Trigger:** Unexpected error or ambiguity.
